Hello there, my name is Hudson and I am a rising Junior at Lehigh University in Behtlehem, Pennsylvania.
At Lehigh, I am fortunate enough to be a part of the Computer Science and Business program (CSB).

Outside of the classroom, I strive to consistently learn new technologies and frameworks in hopes of becoming an increasingly versatile developer.
Some topics I am passionate about include web development, database systems, and cloud computing.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on in the recent past:

Designing and implementing a database system { https://github.com/Hudson-Pavia/CSE241_Insurance-Company_Database-Systems

Building Node.js APIs for use in a MERN app {    https://github.com/Hudson-Pavia/Basic-Node-API-notes_app || https://github.com/Hudson-Pavia/Restful-API2
