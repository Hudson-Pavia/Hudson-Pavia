Hello there, my name is Hudson and I am a senior at Lehigh University in Behtlehem, Pennsylvania.
At Lehigh, I am fortunate enough to be a part of the Computer Science and Business program (CSB).

Outside of the classroom, I strive to consistently learn new technologies and frameworks in hopes of becoming an increasingly versatile developer.
Some topics I am passionate about include web3 development, database systems, and cryptography.
